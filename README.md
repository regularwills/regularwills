## Hi!ðŸ‘‹  I'm Will
<br></br>
I am a CS student based in Los Angeles, CA. I am studying concurrent and distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and software engineering with agile development.
I primarily enjoy embedded programming in C/C++, but I also spend a lot of time with Python and web applications through Django, Docker, and PostgreSQL.

- âš¡ I love talking with all types of developers and finding tips and insights about the tools you use
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot about hardware and electronics to help me become a better embedded programmer so I don't electrocute myself and others.
