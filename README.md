## Hi!ðŸ‘‹  I'm Will
<br></br>
I am a CS student based in Los Angeles, CA. I am studying concurrent and distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and software engineering with agile development.
I primarily enjoy embedded programming in C/C++, but I am also spending a lot of time with Python and web applications through Django, Docker, and PostgreSQL.

- âš¡ I love talking with all types of developers and finding tips and insights about the tools you use
- ðŸ¦¾ I'm currently working on a dog treat launcher, a Raspberry Pi gaming handheld, and 2 web applications in different frameworks
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot about hardware and electronics to help me become a better-embedded programmer so I also don't shock myself and others.

### Skills
